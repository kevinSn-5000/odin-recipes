        </ul>

        <h3 class="title">Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, we boil 500gr of tomatoes, the 40gr of onion,
                5gr of garlic, 40gr of the serrano chili and a little
                cilantro.
            </li>
            <li>Once they are cook, we remove the water and liquate
                our ingredients to make our delicious sauce for the 
                enchiladas.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, we stir-fry the sauce in a previously hot frying pan
                with oil, and add flavor with salt and pepper at ease. Now
                we wait for the sauce to cook a little.
            </li>
            <li>For the chicken, we have to cook it in hot water with a piece
                of onion and let it cook for 15 minutes. Once it's cooked,
                we let it cool and then we shred the chicken.
            </li>
            <li>Going on with the recipe we have to put the tortillas
                in warm oil and remove the excess of it once we put them out.
                We don't want tortilla chips, but neither the raw tortilla,
                mind that the texture is manageable and resistent.
            </li>
            <li>Now, finally for making the enchiladas, we grab a tortilla,
                fill it with chicken and give it form by bending the tortilla.<br>
                To let them perfect we pour the sauce all over our enchiladas, all along
                with the chess, cream, avocado and a twig of cilantro.<br>
                If you wish tou can add some rice by the enchiladas.
                Now our dish is completed and all that is left is to enjoy our 
                creation!
